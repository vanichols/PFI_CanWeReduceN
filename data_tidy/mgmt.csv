Sieren,observation,2022-05-12,"my planter fert was giving me fits, and i didn't get as much n applied as i wanted, so it was reducing the amount all by itself!  i'll figure out what i need for the two rates, and make it up when i sidedress the rest."
Sieren,observation,2022-06-17,sidedressed 32% n on whole field except the 4 reduced rate reps which didn't get any. resulted in 59.5 lb n/ac difference between typical and reduced.
Sieren,observation,2022-10-24,"this was strip-tilled without anhydrous, so i think my n was short up front, since i didn't get as much on with the planter as i had hoped.  i think i lost some moisture with the strip-till pass, which hurt as well.  every 1/2"" of moisture was needed this year!  maybe the rye took too much before termination as well!"
Sieren,observation,2022-10-24,"we should've had abundant n from the fall applied manure, but it was either leached too deep, or the roots didn't have enough moisture to find it.  same with the side dressed n...it should've been sufficient but the yield results clearly show it wasn't.  it might have been more effective if it had been applied with a y-drop, instead of in the dry row middles, where the roots probably couldn't get to it all. "
Sieren,observation,2022-10-24,"i think it was planted too heavy at 36,000.  32,000 would've yielded just as well this year.  the ear size was small, which was also a hint of too little n available at v5-v6, when ear size is determined."
Sieren,observation,2022-10-24,"this field started firing a month before my others did, which also indicated an n deficiency.  just not enough n at the right time, in the right place, where it was available to the plants.  oh, yeah, more water please!"
Sieren,observation,2022-10-24,"i've been wanting to get away from the extra trip with the strip-till, and this year might've convinced me to do it!  i had good results here at home with it, but the no-till was also good across the road at 150 bpa, and that's my most drought prone farm with its thinner timber soil!  just a lot of variability everywhere this year! "
